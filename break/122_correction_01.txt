Team 122's implementation of logread does not indicate if an employee enters 
a room, leaves the room, then immediately re-enters the same room by 
outputting n,n where "n" represents the room number.  For example, if 
employee Jack enters room 1, leaves room 1, then re-enters room 1, the Oracle
outputs "1,1".  Team 122's implementation of logread outputs "1" in response to
"logread -K secret -R -E Jack log2".
