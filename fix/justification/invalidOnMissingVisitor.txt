The bugs fixed by this submission should be rejected during the dispute process
due to contradictory instructions by the spec. Since the spec is contradictory
there is no notion of supporting this behavior correctly or incorrectly. We are
submitting fixes to match the oracle anyways in case our dispute fails.

-------------------------

Consider bug 6571. It uses the logread -I command and specifies a visitor -G Joe.
Joe was never a visitor to the gallery. In such cases, the spec is contradictory.
However, the oracle prints nothing and returns 0. Our software prints invalid
and returns 255. This fix aligns our implementation with the oracle.

To fix the issue, I added a MissingVisitorException that is thrown when a
specified visitor is missing. The logread -I code catches this exception and
then sets a flag to print nothing.
