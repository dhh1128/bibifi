IMPORTANT - This is a partial fix for bug 21382, which exhibits multiple
issues. This submission will not resolve 21382 completely. I understand, per
e-mail subject "Bug with multiple issues", that it is okay to fix issues in any
order we desire, so as to reduce our team’s unique bug count, even if that 
results in rejected fix submissions.

The other issues should cause 21382 to be rejected anyway during the dispute
process. However, I am fixing it should the dispute fail.

----------------------------

21382 exhibits an issue where two visitors, -E FredI and -G FredI, are
considered to be the same visitor by the algorithm responsible for printing the
logread –I output.

The result is that the algorithm ignores the room history of one of these
visitors.

The problem is that the algorithm tests if two visitors are the same person by
using the equals() method. The equals method, however, only considers the
visitor's name. It does not consider the visitor's type.

To correct the issue I had to add a visitor type field to the Visitor object
and include the new field in the equality check. I also had to update visitor
serialization to populate this field.
