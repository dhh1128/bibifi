We were printing "invalid" when unable to save a logfile, but we were
returning 0 instead of 255 because we didn't check for success of .save()
method. The breaks (for example, 20543) were catching the fact that we
differed from the oracle in the return code. We now detect failure to save
and return 255, per spec.
