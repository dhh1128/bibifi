We were not tolerating whitespace at the beginning of batch lines. Two bugs, 16663 and 16665,
captured scenarios where the oracle did tolerate leading whitespace. Thus, we were printing
"invalid" where the oracle printed nothing. This fix causes us to silently ignore leading
whitespace in batch lines.
